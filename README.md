# CS5721 Software Design Project - Smart Bin

Smart Bin is a dedicated Bin Management solution for cities and businesses to digitize waste bin inventories, manage bin distribution and make data-driven decisions. It is totally sensor-less, thus doing away with the need to monitor real-time data on fill-level.

The proposed solution is a web application for use by registered customers, truck drivers and the administrator of Bin Company. Smart Bin allows:

- The administrator at the Bin Company to build a detailed bin inventory, optimize bin locations, schedule and plan trips with shortest possible paths to reach optimum truck capacity. 
- Customers registered with the Bin Company to raise requests to pick their bins with the click of a button.
- Truck Drivers to view their daily assignments for bin pickups, start and complete their trips. <br/><br/>
